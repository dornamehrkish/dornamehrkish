      <p>Helpshift is an in-app customer support platform. In the past year, I was involved in the launch of one of its newest products, <a href="https://www.helpshift.com/features/" class="external-link">Campaigns.</a> </p>
      </br>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Project Management, UI Design</p>
      <p><strong>Platform:</strong> Desktop</p>

      <h2 id="background"> Background</h2>
    </p>One of the most underrated perks of working at a startup like Helpshift is role fluidity -- as long as I was able to propose a working solution to something (related to my role), I was able to manage the project from beginning to end.  As a Customer Success Manager, my performance was based on several indicators: </p>
    <ul class="case-list">
    <li>Renewal rate for accounts I was managing</li>
    <li>Feature adoption rates </li>
    <li>Upsells/Add-ons for products</li>
    <li>Overall customer health score</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The biggest challenge was showing value to each customer at each stage of their journey. As we grew, this became a challenge not only due to limited internal resources, but because of a dynamic product.  Without a product marketing team, the Customer Success team was responsible for product education. </p>
    </br>
    <p>For about a year, Helpshift‚Äôs latest product, Campaigns, was soft launched to a subset of customers. Campaigns is an engagement tool that allows companies with mobile apps to send contextual messages to their end-users.  In early 2017, the decision was made to launch the product to all customers for free (in their environment), and keep certain features of Campaigns paid. We had three weeks to execute a plan to prepare our customers for this change.
    </p>



    <p>After several brainstorm meetings with other stakeholders, a few questions remained:</p>
    <ul class="case-list">
      <li>What is the best pricing model for this product?</li>
      <li>How can the team incentivize customers to add-on the paid version to their normal plan? </li>
      <li>What is the best way to capture interest, with little friction for the customer?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="solution"> Solution</h2>
    <p>The first thing we had to decide was how we wanted to deliver the product announcement. Creating any sort of marketing asset takes time, and we needed to make the most of our three weeks .  The marketing team began work on blog and original video content, but I still felt that there needed to be a central place for customers to:</p>
    <ul class="case-list">
    <li>Learn about the product</li>
    <li>Get in touch with the team </li>
    <li>Visit other feature pages</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It made sense to have a single landing page that would be distributed through an email campaign, through sales, and through the blog. I created a few wireframes to show my peers:</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div class="thumbnail">
            <a href="../assets/helpshift/lp_wireframe_1.png" target="_blank">
              <img src="../assets/helpshift/lp_wireframe_1.png" alt="wireframe version one" style="width:100%">
            </a>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div class="thumbnail">
            <a href="../assets/helpshift/lp_wireframe_2.png" target="_blank">
              <img src="../assets/helpshift/lp_wireframe_2.png" alt="wireframe version two" style="width:100%">
            </a>
          </div>

        </div>
      </div>

<p>It was quickly decided to move forward with the second version for a few reasons:</p>
<ul class="case-list">
  <li>Our customers range from Support Managers to Product Managers, to  Mobile Developers. We needed a page that communicated to each persona. In-page navigation solved for that. </li>
  <li>It made sense to highlight our new video above the fold. This meant we needed to remove the previous video (testimonial). </li>
</ul>

<p>I got the greenlight to continue with the design and deployment of the landing page. Because time was a constraint, we couldn‚Äôt follow the company‚Äôs usual process for releasing a feature. Following the UI Design, I was able to publish the page on a temporary domain (because this was strictly for a product launch).</p>

<p> Once it was live, I sat down with our Product Manager and other CSMs to conduct quick usability tests on the page. I also aimed for design consistency with helpshift.com, making sure I followed the style guide appropriately. </p>
</br>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <div class="thumbnail">
        <a href="../assets/helpshift/lp_mock.png" target="_blank">
          <img src="../assets/helpshift/lp_mock.png" alt="final ui" style="width:100%">
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</br>
</br>
<h2 id="distro"> Distribution </h2>

<p>As a CSM, one of my duties was to plan our monthly newsletters to our customers, as well as any dedicated product-related emails. For this project, I planned a two-part email series with our Product Manager that linked to the landing page. I also made sure to communicate how the product had changed up until then, as well as highlight current users of the product. Click through rates from the email were around 7% (higher than normal). </p>

<p>We also were able to send users to this page directly from the product itself to boost adoption rates. The link was embedded in Helpshift‚Äôs Dashboard, visible to admins only, along with some helpful text that introduces the feature. </p>
<p> The product was now available to everyone:</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <div class="thumbnail">
        <a href="../assets/helpshift/newcp.gif" target="_blank">
          <img src="../assets/helpshift/newcp.gif" alt="campaign builder">
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
<h2 id="learn"> What I Learned</h2>

<p> I found myself learning how to sell my recommendations,  with much more thought.  The best way for our customers to quickly use a product (and to get addicted to it) is if they can intuitively learn it. In the weeks following the launch of Campaigns, I closely monitored actual adoption rates, and reached out to customers for early feedback. This helped product and sales teams improve their processes. </p>

<p>This was another lesson in adaptability. Normally, with a design project, I would follow a strict process that began with user interviews and research, before jumping into wireframes. I would also align my objectives closer with other departments, to prevent overlap. This was an edge-case, in that I was given responsibilities I normally wouldn‚Äôt have due to the lack of time. As with many projects during my time at Helpshift, I worked hard, aimed for perfection, but realized perfect was not ideal. Uncertainty prevails, and it‚Äôs better to get things done rather than how it ‚Äúshould‚Äù be. </p>
